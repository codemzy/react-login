react-login
=================

This is a starter react app with a log in, register and log out components pre-built. You can [demo it here](https://codemzy.github.io/react-login/).

On the demo, enter any email and password to log in or register. Your details won't be saved. It's just the front end, so all the api calls in `src/app/api/user.js` are dummy calls, wire it up to a real api for your projects. I usually use [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) for api requests, but anything can be used. If you are thinking about using firebase, check out my other project [react-firebase-auth](https://github.com/codemzy/react-firebase-auth).

I've used [bootstrap v4](https://getbootstrap.com/) but this can be replaced with another framework or custom css.
